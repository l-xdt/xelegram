## FAQ

**Now, my fav, FAQ!**

#### Can I modify this to fit my needs?

Totally! That is what we make these repositories for. For you tinker and to try new things.

#### Can I host this? If I can how?

You can! with my favourite Apache container, XAMPP! Since I have explained it atleast 12 times, we can skip it.

If you want to go ahead with it, you can get started by hosting your websites, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzucEZh4_no) to following the tutorial by MainlyWebStuff.
